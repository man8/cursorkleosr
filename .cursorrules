# PROJECT-WIDE DIRECTIVES
1. All .mdc rules in .cursor/rules take precedence
2. Default to TypeScript unless specified otherwise
3. Use AWS SDK v3 patterns for cloud integrations
4. Prefer named exports over default exports
5. Document all @todo comments in JIRA format
6. Follow security-first development practices
7. Implement automated testing for all changes
8. Use context-aware documentation generation

# MCP CONFIGURATION
- Primary servers: Sequential Thinking, OpenRouter, DeepLucid
- Fallback strategy: Local context → MCP → Manual
- Context window: 32768 tokens
- Concurrent agents: 3-4 maximum
- Learning rate: Adaptive based on performance
- Confidence threshold: 80% for high-risk changes

# AI INTEGRATION RULES
1. Sequential Thinking:
   - Use DeepLucid methodology for all complex tasks
   - Break down problems into numbered steps
   - Include dependency mapping
   - Validate solutions through OpenRouter

2. Code Analysis:
   - Implement multi-phase directory scanning
   - Use gitignore-aware file filtering
   - Cache results for performance
   - Clear cache every 24 hours

3. Documentation:
   - Generate context-aware markdown files
   - Use intelligent naming conventions
   - Include clear descriptions and boundaries
   - Track changes via Linear

4. Security:
   - Validate all file paths
   - Prevent access to sensitive directories
   - Log all operations
   - Implement security checks

5. Performance:
   - Use efficient glob patterns
   - Implement caching with versioning
   - Optimize API calls
   - Monitor resource usage
